This is README.md documenting what my program does, how to build it, how to play it.
=====================

*  The game is called "MINI MATH GAME" built under the implementation of Language C++ and BBC micro:bit
*  The program is going to do the MINI MATH GAME displayed on BBC micro:bit

HOW TO PLAY MINI MATH GAME
=====================

* At First, players have to press BUTTON A and B together to start the game ( Follow the instruction displayed on the micro:bit)
*  Micro:bit will display some operations including (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and players have to answer each operation whether it is true or false 
*  Pressing BUTTON A to AGREE with the operation
*  Pressing BUTTON B to DISAGREE with the operation
*  After 10 operations, the score will be appeared on scale of 10 of how many operations you answer it correct

HOW TO BUILD MINI MATH GAME
==================

*  WHILE LOOP and If-Else Statement, nested If-Else statement are widely used to build this game
*  using switch case and some logical comparisons to check and execute
*  Simple structure and Libraries included such as cstdlib,ctime for random functions
*  MicroBitImage.h to support adding Image ( arrow, smile face, sad face)
*  MicroBit.h to support using some functions to display and print commands on BB micro:bit
*  the main.cpp is in microbit-samples/sources/main.cpp including with README.md
*  Overall, it is a very simple game and easy to build, hope you have fun.
